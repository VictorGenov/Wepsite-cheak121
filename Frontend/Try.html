        GameMaker Studio 2 is a free games development software that will help you create a complete game using a graphical interface. GameMaker Studio 2 comes with a C-like scripting Game Maker Language, which offers great options to users.
        Its key advantage is that it supports different formats and platforms, like Windows, Mac, Linux, HTML5, Android and iOS, so you can publish games without changing the code.
        You can add in-app purchases to the game and install analytics to track your game activity.
